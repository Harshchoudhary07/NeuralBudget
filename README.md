## 🚀 **Neural Budget AI**
**Neural Budget AI** is an intelligent financial management application designed to simplify your personal finances. Built with a powerful backend powered by Django and a dynamic JavaScript frontend, it leverages AI to provide smart expense tracking, budgeting, and insightful analytics. The application uses Firebase for secure user authentication and Firestore for scalable, real-time data storage.

This project addresses the challenges of modern financial management by integrating **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)**, **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, and **predictive analytics** to simplify expense tracking and budgeting. It aims to bridge the gap between financial awareness and effective money management by reducing manual data entry, improving prediction accuracy, and providing users with tailored recommendations.

## 🏆 **Key Features**

### **User Management & Authentication**
*   **Secure Login & Registration:** Users can create an account and log in securely using their email and password, authenticated via Firebase.
*   **User-Specific Data:** Every user has their own dedicated data space in Firestore, ensuring privacy and personalization.
*   **Personalized Profiles:** Users can view and update their profile information, including their name, profile picture, and other personal details.
*   **Password Reset:** A secure password reset functionality is available, allowing users to reset their password via a link sent to their email.

### **Financial Tracking & Management**
*   **Smart Expense Categorization:** Upload a receipt or a screenshot of a transaction, and the AI-powered OCR (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash) will automatically extract details like amount, merchant, and date, categorize the expense, and record it seamlessly.
*   **Manual Transactions:** Users can manually add income and expenses via intuitive forms, selecting from predefined or custom categories.
*   **Budgeting & Savings Goals:** Set monthly budgets for categories (e.g., food, travel) with real-time tracking and alerts for overspending; track progress toward savings goals with visual indicators.
*   **Transaction History:** View a detailed, searchable history of all transactions with filters by date, category, or amount.

### **AI-Powered Insights & Analytics**
*   **Spending Analysis:** Interactive dashboards with charts and graphs (Matplotlib/Seaborn) breaking down spending habits by category, time, and trends.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning models (Scikit-learn) forecast future expenses, detect patterns, and provide actionable insights to optimize spending.
*   **Investment Guide:** Personalized recommendations and tips for investments based on spending patterns and financial goals.
*   **AI-Powered Chatbot:** An interactive, real-time chatbot using Google Generative AI to answer queries (e.g., "What's my food spending this month?") and offer tailored financial advice.

### **Developer & Testing Tools**
*   **Data Generation:** Built-in tools to generate realistic historical or test data for transactions and budgets, aiding development and testing.
*   **Reports & Visualizations:** Comprehensive reporting module for exporting insights and generating custom visualizations.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Separate apps for accounts, budgets, transactions, insights, and more, with shared utilities for Firebase integration and auth middleware for secure sessions.

## 🛠️ **Running the Project Locally**

### **Prerequisites**
*   Python 3.8+
*   Pip
*   Virtualenv (recommended)

### **Setup Instructions**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anmolkumaarsiing/NeuralBudget.git
    cd NeuralBudget
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```

4.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    *   Place your Firebase service account key file named `firebase_key.json` inside the `apps` directory.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and other sensitive information.
    *   Make sure to add `firebase_key.json` and `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing them.

5.  **Run the database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

7.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
